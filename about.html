        <p align="center"><strong><em><font color="#004381">I make various digital products from 2018. 
            <br />Once upon a time.... my friend was a Nameday and I decided to surprise her. 
            <br />I made a greetings card and my friend was really pleased. She told me: "I did not know you are so creative."
            <br />I thought about it and I have started to make some digital products. First it was a website with the <a href="https://cardofnameday.wordpress.com/">greetings cards</a>, then <a href="https://milkmush.wordpress.com/">second website</a>. 
            <br />Now I know <a href="https://primereditorial.wordpress.com">more things</a> like at the beginning. Maybe you ask why did not hear about it? I engage in it in my free time. It is a hobby only now.
            <br />If you want one or more digital products, you can <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. Thank you.
